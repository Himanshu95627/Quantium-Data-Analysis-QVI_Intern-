# Quantium-Data-Analytics-Program
## Here is the background information on your task
You are part of Quantium’s retail analytics team and have been approached by your client, the Category Manager for Chips, who wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region. The insights from your analysis will feed into the supermarket’s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year.


## Module 1- Data Prepration and Consumer Behaviour 
Creating and interpreting high level summaries of the data Finding outliers and removing these (if applicable) Checking data formats and correcting (if applicable) You will also want to derive extra features such as pack size and brand name from the data and define metrics of interest to enable you to draw insights on who spends on chips and what drives spends for each customer segment. Remember our end goal is to form a strategy based on the findings to provide a clear recommendation to Julia the Category Manager so make sure your insights can have a commercial application.

## Module 2- EXperiment and uplift testing
Experimentation and uplift testing Extend your analysis from Task 1 to help you identify benchmark stores that allow you to test the impact of the trial store layouts on customer sales. This can be broken down by: total sales revenue total number of customers average number of transactions per customer Create a measure to compare different control stores to each of the trial stores to do this write a function to reduce having to re-do the analysis for each trial store. Consider using Pearson correlations or a metric such as a magnitude distance e.g. 1- (Observed distance – minimum distance)/(Maximum distance – minimum distance) as a measure.
